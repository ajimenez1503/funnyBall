# funnyBall
Computer Game in Unity. There is a board which you can rotate in axis X and Z, with limits on the borders. You can move the board with the arrow (Up,Down,Right,Left) of the keyboard. The goal is moving the ball through the labyrinth of obstacles and going to a specific place. You have to tilt the board and the gravity will roll the ball.
